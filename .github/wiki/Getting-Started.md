# Getting Started with PestoFTC

This guide will help you get started with PestoFTC and show you how to implement basic functionality in your FTC robot.

## Prerequisites
- Completed [Installation Guide](Installation-Guide)
- Basic understanding of Java/Kotlin
- Familiarity with FTC SDK

## Basic Implementation

### 1. Setting Up Your Robot Class
```java
public class MyRobot extends PestoRobot {
    @Override
    public void init() {
        super.init();
        // Initialize your robot components here
    }
}
```

### 2. Basic Drivebase Setup
```java
// In your robot class
private Drivebase drivebase;

@Override
public void init() {
    super.init();
    drivebase = new MecanumDrivebase(hardwareMap);
}
```

### 3. Creating Your First Command
```java
public class DriveCommand extends Command {
    private final Drivebase drivebase;
    private final double power;

    public DriveCommand(Drivebase drivebase, double power) {
        this.drivebase = drivebase;
        this.power = power;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        drivebase.setPower(power);
    }
}
```

### 4. Using the Command System
```java
// In your teleop or autonomous
CommandScheduler.getInstance().schedule(new DriveCommand(drivebase, 0.5));
```

## Next Steps

1. **Explore Components**
   - Review the [Core Components](Core-Components) documentation
   - Choose the features you need for your robot

2. **Implement Vision**
   - Check the [Vision System](Vision-System) guide
   - Set up camera processing

3. **Configure Drivebase**
   - Read the [Drivebase Systems](Drivebase-Systems) documentation
   - Implement appropriate drivebase for your robot

4. **Use Tuning Tools**
   - Review the [Tuning Tools](Tuning-Tools) guide
   - Optimize your robot's performance
